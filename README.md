Hex is a six legged OpenSource Hexapod designed to serve as a moving platform for you to tinker with and build on top of! We are currently working on the third generation of the platform, Hex3.

This repo is currently in development! As of Hex3, we plan to start using github releases to signal when design changes are ready for you to use! If you want to be notified about releases, consider joining our Discord! (linked below)
