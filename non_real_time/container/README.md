# Usage
1. Assure docker and docker-compose are installed on your system and that docker commands can be used without privelege escalation
2. Navigate to the container directory
3. Build the container with ```./build.sh``` (if you are having issues with this, try pasting the .sh file contents and running from cmd line)
4. Follow the below Development Usage or Producation Usage instructions depending on your use case

# Development Usage 
1. Start the container with ```./init_dev.sh```
2. Create shells running inside the container with ```./new_dev_shell.sh```
3. When shutting down use ```./stop_dev.sh```

### Important Notes:
- when inside a shell in order to create hexapod publisher or listener nodes you must first run ```. ./init.sh```. Then you can create new nodes using the bash scripts ```./create_sub.sh``` or ```./create_pub.sh```
- When started with ```./init_dev.sh``` the container will be running in idle mode until stopped with ```./stop_dev.sh```
- For changes to go into effect in development the container does not need to be rebuilt after the initial build, but to move to production, it will be
- Make sure all code that is intended to run during container operation resides in the src directory
- Make sure any system packages or python packages installed get added to ```setup/system-requirements.txt``` or ```setup/python-requirements.txt``` for those packages to be included into the container at the next build

# Production Usage
1. Start the production container with ```./init_prod.sh```
